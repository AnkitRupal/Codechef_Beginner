# Codechef_Beginner
The following repository contains codes for the Beginner Level Problems for Codechef Practice Problems!!
Most of the problems are solved with the help of C++ language but some problems (like small factorials)
is solved using Python 3.6 due to some restrictions in storage limits of variables in C++!! Therefore,
python is generally used for solving those problems which have large data storage requirements and require
large variable data storage facility!!
These Solutions are provided for the user to find new concepts and retain them for application in some
new problem on there own!! Ofcourse, it is practice problems and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO FIRST GIVE THE
PROBLEM A FAIR TRY , WHICH IT TRUELLY DESERVES!!! If not able to solve then only consult these
solutions!!
This repository only provides solutions for the practice Problems and NOT FOR THE ONGOING CONTESTS AT
CODECHEF!!!! BE GENUINE AND HONEST BECAUSE EVEN IF BY SOME UNFAIR MEANS YOU GET A GOOD RATING AND GET 
A GOOD JOB, THE EMPLOYERS WILL EVENTUALLY GET TO THE TRUTH!! MY HUMBLE REQUEST NOT TO INDULGE INSUCH 
ACTIVITIES!!!!
